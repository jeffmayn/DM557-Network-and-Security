A) what is the propagation delay?
---- the time it takes a bit to propagate from host A to host B
---- = m/s sec

B) what is the transmission delay?
---- the time it takes host A to push out the entire packet
---- = L/R sec

C) Ignoring queuing and processeing, what is the end to end delay?
---- the time it takes host A to push out the entire packet = L/R sec
---- plus the time for last bit in packet to propagate to host M = m/s sec
---- L/R + m/s

D) at time t = d_trans, where is the last bit of the packet?
---- the bit has just left host A and entered the link

E) suppose d_prop > d_trans, at time t = d_trans, where is the first bit?
---- this means that when host A is done transmitting, the forst bit has
---- not yet reached host B. So the bit is in the link

F) suppose d_prop < d_trans, at time t = d_trans, where is the first bit?
---- this means that when host A is done transmitting, the fist bit has
---- reached host B. So the bit is in host B

G) s = 2.5 x 10^8 m/sec, L = 120 bits, R = 56 kbps. Find m so that d_prop = d_trans
---- L/R = m/s. obtain m = 536 km
